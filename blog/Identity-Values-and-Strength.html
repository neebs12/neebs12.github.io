      <h1>Identity, Values and Strength</h1>

      <h2>How your culture has influenced your values and identity</h2>
      <p>I came from a Filipino background. I attribute this to my values of hard work, respect and community. Despite this, what has primarily influenced me is my family history. I have come from a broken family and ive always seen my father as the person that I did not want to become. He influenced a lot of values that ive come to hold dear to my heart - <em>by being not like him</em>. So ive learned what it means to be a humble person and always practice open mindedness and kindness when interacting with other people.</p>

      <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
      <p>I think my biggest strengths lie in uncompromising dedication and motivation. I will do anything to achieve goals that I have set for myself. I see every day as an opportunity to grow and so I&#39;m always driven to make the most of it. Further to this, I am a very detail oriented person with good abstract &amp; logical reasoning skills. This generally makes me an excellent problem solver.</p>

      <p>As for limitations, I am not a very creative person. My brain simply does not function to create new things or produce new ideas. I have no clue why. Further to this, I am often strict with myself and impose deadlines ahead of time. As a result, I tend to overwork myself even if I don&#39;t realize it.</p>

      <em>How can this help with my Learning Journey?</em>
      <p>I have already been self-learning for the past 8 months (as of April 2022) and have recently graduated from <a href="https://launchschool.com/">LaunchSchool Core</a>. Upon this journey, I have a few methods to help out with managing myself and my learning. </p>

      <p>I keep a data driven journal which aims to summarize and quantify my effort throughout time. This essentially keeps track of my hours with side notes summarizing tasks completed. This gives me insights on when I am hitting certain hours averaged out in a space of 5, 7, 14, 21 and 30 days. These keep track of how close I am to 100% effort or if exceed it for an extended amount of time. </p>

      <p>As an example, if I reach ~&gt;100% effort for a space of a few days, I know that I am mentally close to a burnout and will have to take a break. I know from experience that if I did not take a break and ignore these data-driven insights, that I will experience a harder burnout and wont be in the mental space an effective study session.</p>

      <p>It also gives me an evidence-based overview of how a few days of breaks actually has a net-positive effect on long term learning and general happiness.</p>

      <p><em>Here is an example!</em></p>

      <h2>Situation I had to make an Ethical Decision</h2>
      <p>When I was conducting a site inspection as a Civil Engineer, a colleague and myself were forced to finish the day with only half of our tasks done. Completing the inspection in its entirety would have meant that we would need to drive through roads with little to no visibility (safety hazard). </p>

      <p>On the office the next day, I had a meeting with the manager regarding the situation. He outlined that the project was now going to cost significantly more. Due to this, my manager kept asking if it was my colleague&#39;s fault for the unfinished inspection - while my colleague did make a few key errors during that time - they were honest mistakes. At this moment, I could have easily laid the blame on my colleague for what happened, but I didn&#39;t.</p>

      <p>During this, humility, respect and kindness reflected heavily on my mind. It would have been easy to preserve my image to my manager at that moment in time. However my values dictated that I view my colleague as my equal.</p>

      <h2>Example: Working with Others under Resistance/Tension</h2>
      <p>During my time in engineering, it would not be infrequent to work with hard-headed individuals. I remember working with an engineer that would never change his mind on any matter and would always insist that their way was correct. Strategy that I used at the time was to just be more agreeable and be neutral in my stance so that the project manager is left to deal with them. It was not effective as we ended up wasting more time than what should have been necessary.</p>

      <p>Now, I would approach it with open-mindedness and humility. I would consider their idea as if it were my own and critically think about its advantages and disadvantages and provide my reasoning then when contributing to the conversation.</p>

      <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

      <h2>Long Term Career Goal</h2>
      <p>My long term goal is to work on <em>high-impact SaaS applications as a Software Engineer</em>. I love problem solving and, in programming, there is no shortage of that. Ultimately, I want to in this field that I am passionate at while being able to comfortably financially support my family and extended family in the Philippines.</p>
      
      <h2>Strengths and Limitations with Learning</h2>
      <p>I have always been a keen learner. I find endless satisfaction in learning topics and applying them to solve problems presented in front of me. With programming, the list of topics to learn are not only endless, but are deliberately accessible. I find great fulfillment in acquiring, sharing, and applying knowledge. As for limitations, I am not a very creative individual. I remember taking a personality test for my employer where I scored 15% for Creativity - it sounds about right! I am not very good at generating or brainstorming new ideas. Further to this, I often put unnecessary pressure on my self to complete tasks to self-imposed deadlines.</p>
      
      <h2>Non-technical skills to develop in Dev Academy?</h2>
      <p>I joined Dev Academy with the intent to be surrounded with other individuals deliberate in their pursuit of a career as a programmer. In this environment, I want to build effective communication skills allowing me to deliver technical concepts in an accessible manner - either through writing or verbally. </p>
      <p>I also recognize the importance of relationship building and trust amongst the community, so I want to use the bootcamp to really build relationships with my colleagues and facilitators. Further to this, I would also like to observe how I would perform in collaboration with other individuals in programming project. I have never done this before.</p>
      
      <h2>How will I manage my workload?</h2>
      <p><em>Ensuring Productiveness</em><br>
      I keep track of my own productivity by tracking daily study hours and topping it off with a summary of what I was able to accomplish for that day. This lets me know when I am approaching a burnout phase and may need a break for a certain period of time. </p>

      <p><em>Ensuring Safe Interaction with Colleagues and Facilitators</em><br>
      Be actively aware of the context when discussing information in the social channels. Apply the correct amount of technicality when communicating concepts to other students. Ensure the use of proper pronouns upon entering discussions with others. Treat others as equal and due respect.</p>

      <p><em>Managing Stress</em><br>
      To manage stress, I always step away from the computer and take very frequent breaks when experiencing mental blocks. I recognize that mental blocks are unavoidable and powering through it simply leads to more frustration. </p>
      
      <p>Also, I have to be keenly aware bodily feelings associated with tiredness, frustration and anxiety and use these as objective signs to stop work for a period of time until I have recovered. This includes - tightening chest, shortness of breath, lack of mental clarity.</p>
      
      <p>To avoid time-related stress, I will always ask facilitators and colleagues for clarity if the material becomes too confusing - or if the curriculum is not clear with its requirements. Furthermore, I will also reach out to facilitators when other commitments pop up which may prevent me from submitting my work in a timely manner. </p>
      
      <h2>Expectations of the Facilitation Team</h2>
      <p>Able to give accurate information when asked about a topic and be honest incases where they need to defer me to the documentation if they lack the immediate expertise. Furthermore, I expect them to be honest with their feedback and able to clearly outline if I&#39;m doing something right or wrong. </p>

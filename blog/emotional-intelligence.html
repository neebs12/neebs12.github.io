      <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p> Emotional intelligence is the moderation of primitive emotional impulses by a personâ€™s rational mind - Daniel Goldman</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand ourselves and other people. As such, emotional intelligence can be split in to two different aspects.</p>

      <p><em>Inwardly</em>, development of this intelligence allows us to consciously recognize patterns of embedded within one&#39;s self. Recognition then paves the way for moderation of such patterns when they arise. A good example is recognition of anxiety. This pattern of emotion can arise either with rational explanation (tiredness in a social situation, frustration in learning, etc.) or in unexplainable/unexpected situations. Recognition of such impulses will then allow such an individual to moderate such negative emotion by taking objective steps to mitigate it - meditation, breaks, etc. </p>

      <p><em>Outwardly</em>, development of this intelligence allows us to better realize the patterns of the individuals around us. In that it would be easier to relate to others, empathize with their emotions. A basic example is when encountering another&#39;s anger and recognizing that plain reciprocation will lead to unnecessary escalation.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, emotional intelligence is not to be mistaken as being exclusive with emotions. This intelligence is the capacity to integrate our experiences, and to gain thus a more complete picture of life in every moment. It requires awareness, attention, discipline and freedom to respond to the requirements of the present and not simply following the patterns acquired in the past.</p>

      <h2>What is IQ?</h2>
      <p>IQ or sometimes referred to a general Intelligence (g-factor). It refers to the a broad mental capacity which are often thought of as an amalgamation of a few factors such as Fluid Reasoning, Quantitative reasoning, Visual-spatial reasoning, etc. In a more abstract sense, g-factor can be generally thought of as the effort expended per unit of &#39;change&#39;. The term &#39;change&#39; is used here in relation to the rewiring of the brain to function on some way that differs from how it previously functioned - <em>neuroplasticity</em>. </p>

      <h2>What are their respective importance?</h2>
      <p><em>EQ and IQ have their respective importance</em>. Being developed in one and lacking in the other does not guarantee success or failure. IQ allows us to cognitively adapt with less effort expended - thus objectively allowing for high mental capacity per unit of time. Well developed EQ however allows us to be better humans. It allows us to navigate ourselves and others in our complex environment. It hands us the ability to be in touch with ourselves, and be better <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285420438_The_psychologically_integrated_person_and_the_parameters_of_optimal_functioning">integrated individuals</a>. </p>

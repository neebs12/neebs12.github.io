      <h1>Foundations Reflection</h1>
      <h2>Three things you have learnt about yourself due to Core Learning</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>The importance of reflection</strong> - The reflections that we had to do in core forced me to touch on how I dealt with process of learning - both in the successes and frustrations that comes with it. Personally, reflection gives me much needed opportunity to see how much I has developed and an encouraging outline of my resiliency against frustrations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</strong> - The reflection on neuroplasticity and growth mindset forced to ground my understanding of the topic. It made me appreciate how this mindset has handed me the emotional capacity to endure bouts of frustration and have sustained self motivation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mindfulness</strong> - When we are learning within a restricted timeframe, it is easy to forget about (or even actively ignore) our needs. Covering mindfulness has made me recognize the deficits created by  unsustainable practices. In that, even if these are <em>abstract deficits</em>, they eventually manifest themselves in the form of lack of clarity/patience, presence of anxiety/frustration. Reflection on mindfulness has given me the opportunity to better think about self-care (breaks, exercise, healthy diet) as central to sustaining a wellbeing fit to persist.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What are the roles of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Values</strong> - Values gives us the why when we endure through hard times for the sake of achieving a goal. In the context of learning and programming, values presents the <em>why</em> when we chose to change careers or profession.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Empathy</strong> - Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. In the context of learning and team building, empathy will allow us to be more tolerant of divergent mindsets and ideas - to make us better equipped to objectively consider thoughts which aren&#39;t our own.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Self awareness</strong> - In the context of learning and programming, self awareness allows us to deal with frustration and anxiety with better clarity. Where we could recognize that if we are experiencing frustration, it may be time to ask for help of rest for the day for better clarity for tomorrow. Furthermore, self awareness also allows us to mediate ourselves when we are in communication with another individual.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What surprised you the most about core? Does it feel like core has utility in your learning journey?</h2>
      <p>
        I think what surprised me the most was how much I learned by having to write ideas down. By writing a blog post/article, I was forced to ground abstract concepts and flesh out my understanding of non-technical topics. Personally, I was able to get a better understanding of myself and my journey thus far. I was able to get a better grip of what my values are, challenge my understanding of growth, and outline how I personally cope with frustrations and anxieties.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of real-world utility, I think core touches on a topic that conventional institutions neglect. In their narrow focus to teach technical concepts - the human condition is disproportionally under represented. Having gone through the foundations-core, I think the time spent on it is well-justified. The real world demands that nothing is ever built in isolation - and that one&#39;s ability to communicate and build relationships is just as important as being technically excellent.
      </p>

      <h2>Why do you think we focus so much on core as a web development school?</h2>
      <p>
        Because, in the real world, things are built in teams. When we eventually enter the workforce, we will be joining joining a diverse group of people. This team will consist of different personalities with different values, priorities, proficiencies and ego. The focus in core is made so that we are able to better equipped to adapt in these diverse environments.

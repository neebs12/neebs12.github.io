      <h1>Learning Plan - Bootcamp</h1>

      <h2>Long Term Career Goal</h2>
      <p>
        My long term goal is to work on <em>high-impact SaaS applications as a Software Engineer</em>. I love problem solving and, in programming, there is no shortage of that. Ultimately, I want to be in a field that I am passionate at while being able to financially support my family and extended family in the Philippines.
      </p>

      <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
      <p>
        I think my biggest strength is my solid understanding of the fundamentals. Given this, I believe I am well equipped to pick up the technical concepts covered and explore more modern technologies if possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think my biggest limitation is my lack of the experience of learning with other people. Until now, I have exclusively learned by myself. I am very comfortable in my own space and have intimate knowledge of my own tempo. Being in a set schedule and surrounded by other people in an environment where the intent is learning is an uncertainty for me.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp</h2>
      <p>
        I think my biggest non-technical challenge is adapting to an environment where learning is no longer focused on myself. Personally, I have a rigorous understanding of my proficiencies - so I optimize my time so that I only spend my focus on technologies which I know I have not encountered/mastered prior. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In the bootcamp, I can see (in the curriculum) that I have already gone over some technologies covered in the first few weeks. Personally, I am not very keen on the prospect of having time be non-optionally invested on reviewing topics which I am already familiar with. 
      </p>

      <h2>What human skill would like to see develop while at Bootcamp?</h2>
      <p>
        I would like to see my <em>networking and relationship building</em> skills develop during my time in the bootcamp. I think being able to work in a team is more important - and building connections in an industry one is trying to penetrate is even more so! 
      </p>
      <p>
        Further to this, I would also like to develop my non-technical communication skills. I think it is crucial for an engineer to know how to communicate with other people regarding sharing/communicating technical ideas in a non-technical and accessible manner. 
      </p>

      <h2>Expectations of the Bootcamp team</h2>
      <p>
        Able to give accurate information when asked about a topic and be honest incases where they need to defer me to the documentation if they lack the immediate expertise. Furthermore, I expect them to be honest with their feedback and able to clearly outline if I&#39;m doing something right or wrong. 
      </p>

      <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
      <p>
        My expectations for myself is that I will be kind to myself when I am feeling frustration and anxiety and be proactive in seeking support in times of frustration. Also, I would like to build and foster good relationships with my colleagues and facilitators so that I can create an environment I can reach out to other people just as they can reach out to me without thinking of judgement or discomfort.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for workload management, I will be actively aware of my capacity to complete tasks when they are presented to me and only promise to deliver when I genuinely believe I have the capacity to do so. Further to this, I will also actively seek out support from facilitators and colleagues when required.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for safety, I will be keenly aware of the context I am working under at all times. This is to ensure that whatever interactions that I have with my colleagues is safe, professional, productive and appropriate.
      </p>

      <h1>Learning Plan - Foundations</h1>
      
      <h2>Strengths and Limitations with Learning</h2>
      <p>I have always been a keen learner. I find endless satisfaction in learning topics and applying them to solve problems presented in front of me. With programming, the list of topics to learn are not only endless, but are deliberately accessible. I find great fulfillment in acquiring, sharing, and applying knowledge. As for limitations, I am not a very creative individual. I remember taking a personality test for my employer where I scored 15% for Creativity - it sounds about right! I am not very good at generating or brainstorming new ideas. Further to this, I often put unnecessary pressure on my self to complete tasks to self-imposed deadlines.</p>
      
      <h2>Non-technical skills to develop in Dev Academy?</h2>
      <p>I joined Dev Academy with the intent to be surrounded with other individuals deliberate in their pursuit of a career as a programmer. In this environment, I want to build effective communication skills allowing me to deliver technical concepts in an accessible manner - either through writing or verbally. </p>
      <p>I also recognize the importance of relationship building and trust amongst the community, so I want to use the bootcamp to really build relationships with my colleagues and facilitators. Further to this, I would also like to observe how I would perform in collaboration with other individuals in programming project. I have never done this before.</p>
      
      <h2>How will I manage my workload?</h2>
      <p><em>Ensuring Productiveness</em><br>
      I keep track of my own productivity by tracking daily study hours and topping it off with a summary of what I was able to accomplish for that day. This lets me know when I am approaching a burnout phase and may need a break for a certain period of time. </p>

      <p><em>Ensuring Safe Interaction with Colleagues and Facilitators</em><br>
      Be actively aware of the context when discussing information in the social channels. Apply the correct amount of technicality when communicating concepts to other students. Ensure the use of proper pronouns upon entering discussions with others. Treat others as equal and due respect.</p>

      <p><em>Managing Stress</em><br>
      To manage stress, I always step away from the computer and take very frequent breaks when experiencing mental blocks. I recognize that mental blocks are unavoidable and powering through it simply leads to more frustration. </p>
      
      <p>Also, I have to be keenly aware bodily feelings associated with tiredness, frustration and anxiety and use these as objective signs to stop work for a period of time until I have recovered. This includes - tightening chest, shortness of breath, lack of mental clarity.</p>
      
      <p>To avoid time-related stress, I will always ask facilitators and colleagues for clarity if the material becomes too confusing - or if the curriculum is not clear with its requirements. Furthermore, I will also reach out to facilitators when other commitments pop up which may prevent me from submitting my work in a timely manner. </p>
      
      <h2>Expectations of the Facilitation Team</h2>
      <p>Able to give accurate information when asked about a topic and be honest incases where they need to defer me to the documentation if they lack the immediate expertise. Furthermore, I expect them to be honest with their feedback and able to clearly outline if I&#39;m doing something right or wrong. </p>

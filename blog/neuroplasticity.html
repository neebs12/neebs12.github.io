      <h2>Neuroplastcity</h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
           Neuroplasticity refers to the ability of the brain to modify, change and adapt in both structure and function - <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01657/full#:~:text=Neuroplasticity%20can%20be%20viewed%20as,and%20in%20response%20to%20experience.">fronteirsin</a>

        While most neurons have been created in our ealier years (via <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/adult-neurogenesis-can-we-grow-new-brain-cells-2794885">neurogenesis</a>), the pathways between these neurons can change. When we recall a thought or practise a certain act over and over again, these strengthen existing connections between neurons. While being complimented by <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/synaptic-pruning#research-on-schizophrenia">synaptic pruning</a> - neuroplasticity makes our brains <em>more effective and effecient machines.</em>
      </p>

      <h3>Exercise for our Brains</h3>
      <p>
        The relationship of neuroplasticity with learning is very much analogous to physical execise. Here, we subject ourselves to intensities usually to increase endurance or build strength. Such exercise results in some physical alteration to the body that makes it suitable for the environment it is subjected to - <em>it becomes stronger or able to run for longer</em>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        With learning, the alteration occurs on the brain. Here, we are subjected to intensities that forces the brain to physically alter in structure via neuroplasticity. In that the synaptic connections between our neurons are rearranged to best fit the patterns required to adapt to the material presented to us. The result of this exercise is the - <em>increase in proficiency and skill</em>.
      </p>
      <h3>Energy</h3>
      <p>
        As per any exercise, <em>energy is expended</em>. If we accept that energy is limited for each day, we thus arrive to the conclusion that we can only learn so much per unit of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Honesty of this inherent limitation, what I believe, is the natural progression from acknowledging neuroplasticity. By being realistic with our respective limitations we adopt healthier conclusions like: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Appreciation for energy and time </li>
        <li>Recognition that frustration is simply a natural expression of energy depletion</li>
        <li>Toleration of short-term discomfort for <em>lasting change</em> </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To build on to this, such honest appreciations only encourages individuals to seek ways to increase one&#39;s capacity for learning by adopting healthy habits such as proper diet, physical exercise, etc.
      </p>

      <h2>The Growth Mindset</h2>
      <p>
        According to stanford psychologist <a href="https://onedublin.org/2012/06/19/stanford-universitys-carol-dweck-on-the-growth-mindset-and-education/">Carol Dweck</a>, the growth mindset is an individual&#39;s implicit theory of intelligence which understands that talents and abilities can be developed overtime. The growth mindset applies a mental framework that values work above natural ability. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, the growth mindset is a bedrock of my personal mental framework. According to my <a href="https://principlesyou.com/archetypes/growthseeker">Principles You</a> results, I fit the archetype of a <em>growth seeker</em>.
      </p>

      <h3>The Positive Feedback Loop</h3>
      <p>
        I see this growth mindset as creating a positive feedback loop towards some goal. With such a mindset, the belief that one can <em>eventually achieve</em> is crucial to sustained self-motivation. This allows for an individual to stay the path in times of frustration and experience strengthened resolve once milestones are reached! 
      </p>
      <p>
        In my learning journey, one of the ways I integrated the growth mindset is via my journalling. I write my failures just as I write my successes. Every once in a while, when I am in need of inspiration, I consult my journal and objectively relfect on the times that I had to work through extreme frustration and/or when I have reached key milestones.
      </p>
      <h3>Tolerance for Doubt and Frustration</h3>
      <p>
        On the flip-side - appreciation of limitations allows me to deal with bouts of frustration - which I have often. <em>Grounding learning as simply another energy expending activity</em> allows me to hit the mental breaks when I need to. I get to appreciate that rest is just as crucial as <em>active focus hours</em> and have data driven self-evidence to refer to when needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        In times of <em>extreme</em> frustration and doubt, my growth mindset has really pulled through in saving my learning journey. Launch School&#39;s <a href="https://launchschool.com/pedagogy">pedagogy</a> is such that assessments are designed to be rigorous and blocking - with no limitation in preparation time. During this journey, I experienced no shortage of frustration and doubt! However the mental framework that <em>growth takes time</em> gave me the patience and emotional capacity to perservere and stick to the path.
